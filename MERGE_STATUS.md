# Merge attempt status

* Attempted to fetch `origin/main` to resolve conflicts and merge latest changes.
* Fetch failed due to restricted network access (HTTP 403 via CONNECT), so no merge was performed.
* Existing branch logic remains unchanged; rerun the merge once network access to `github.com` is available.
